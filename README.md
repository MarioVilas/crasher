Crasher/Catcher Tool (2007)
---------------------------

This was a simple userspace crash generator and catcher for Windows that I wrote in 2007. It's here just for backup and nostalgia. :)

I used it to fuzz... I don't even remember what target, the catcher kept evolving, and at some point I decided a complete rewrite was needed with 100% my own Python code instead of using vtrace and pydbg. That's how [winappdbg](https://github.com/MarioVilas/winappdbg) was born!

The crash generator I kept using for years as a quick way to test winappdbg's own crash processing tool.
